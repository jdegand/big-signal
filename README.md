# Big Signal

[Angular Challenges](https://github.com/tomalaforge/angular-challenges) Big Signal Solution

## Information

In this challenge, you can imagine a big application where you store your user state inside a service and you use this service to use your user anywhere in your application.
The issue is when you update one property of your user, the entire application is updating.

I added the `CDFlashingDirective` to vizualise when one component is rerendering.

## Statement

With Signal, you can now be more fine-grained in what the UI is rerendering. The goal of this challenge is to understand why everything is rerendering and you refactor the application to be more performante.

## Thoughts

- Used CDN for Tailwind CSS styling.   
- Possible explanation: `When you read a signal within an OnPush component's template, Angular tracks the signal as a dependency of that component. When the value of that signal changes, Angular automatically marks the component to ensure it gets updated the next time change detection runs.`
- `In case an input receives a mutable object as value and you modify the object but preserve the reference, Angular will not invoke change detection. Thatâ€™s the expected behavior because the previous and the current value of the input point to the same reference.`
- `Signal Components, envisioned for future Angular versions, will provide a more fine-grained behavior: Only changed parts of components will be checked. These parts will be embedded views defined by structural directives like ngFor or ngIf.`
- Can't maintain type safety in templates with signal objects.
